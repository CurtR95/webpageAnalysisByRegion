# Web Crawler Designed to Analyse Regional Differences

Based off code shared by Answer in Progress (<https://sabrinas.space/>) and Grigory Serebryakov (<https://learnopencv.com/t-sne-for-feature-visualization/>). This code is designed to grab the top 100 websites of a region specified in the index - pre-set to GB and JP. Designed for a paper to investigate the regional differences between web development of Japan and Great Britain and discover the reasoning for these regional differences. It utilises SEMrush for the data due to the ease of access.
NOTE: Whilst the code itself is not designed to access adult content, due to the popularity of adult content on SEMrush's top 100 lists, there is a high likelihood that adult content will be accessed.
